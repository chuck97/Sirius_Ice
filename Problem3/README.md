The second problem is to investigate influence of ice-model parameters on LKF quality.

The folder consists of:

*./Src* - the folder with source code of ice model;

*Problem3.pdf* - the description of problem (will be discussed in class);

*./configs* - folder containing the example of configuration files (and launcher);

Before building the code make sure, that you have built INMOST with Petsc/Parmetis support and also cloned nlohmann_json!

To build the code, edit your ./Src/CMakeLists.txt. The instructions of running the code are given in Problem3.pdf.

The description of the problem is presented in the end of Problem3.pdf.
