gui_glut - interactive 3D surface mesh generator (glut version)

This package is based on freeglut library (http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/).
In order to use this package, make sure freeglut is properly installed on your system.
If your library is installed in non-standard place, the correct paths should be added into Makefile



Usage: gui_glut.exe [+csp] [params]
Press 'h' for help

"+s r x y z r p q M" - M-mesh for a sphere with radius r, centered at (x, y, z) and rotated by angles r, p, q
"+c r h x y z r p q M" - M-mesh for a cylinder with radius r, height h, centered at (x, y, z) and rotated by angles r, p, q
"+p a b c x y z a b c M" - M-mesh for a parallelepiped with radius r, centered at (x, y, z) and rotated by angles r, p, q

Usage example:
./gui_glut.exe    
   prints help message

./gui_glut.exe +s 1.5 0 0 1 0 0 0 0.3 +c 0.5 5 0 0 -1 0.3 0 0.5 0.3
   creates a 0.3-mesh for sphere with radius 1.5, centered at (0, 0, 1) and rotated by angles 0, 0, 0
   and a 0.3-mesh for cylinder with radius 0.5, height 5, centered at (0, 0, -1) and rotated by angles 0.3, 0 and 0.5

./gui_glut.exe +s 1.5 0 0 1 0 0 0 0.2 +p 0.5 0.6 2 0 -1 0 0.3 0 0.1 0.2
   creates a 0.2-mesh for the same sphere
   and a 0.2-mesh for parallelepiped with sides 0.5, 0.6 and 2, centered at (0, -1, 0) and rotated by angles 0.3, 0 and 0.1
