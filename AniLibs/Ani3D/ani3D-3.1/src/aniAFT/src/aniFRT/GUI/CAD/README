A brief introduction to Open CASCADE GUI DRAWEXE.

It is used to produce a .brep file:

  DRAWEXE

A new window with a menu will appear, while terminal could be used to execute commands.
First command in DRAWEXE should be 'pload' to load main modules.

   pload

Use command 'help' to get the list of available commands, and 'help command' to print help 
on the specific command.

For visualization use menu 'Views' or commands:

   axo    // One axonometric view
   pers   // One perspective view
   mu4    // Four views layout

   zoom z // change zoom
   fit    // change zoom to fit image

   l, r, u, d      // rotate left, right, up, down
   pl, pr, pu, pd  // panning left, right, up, down

For creating objects use commands like:

   box name x1 y1 z1 dx dy dz
   psphere name R
   pcylinder name R H

For boolean operation on two shaped use commands:

   bfuse R a b
   bcommon R a b
   bcut R a b

Command 'source file' may be used to read commands from file.
Command 'save shape file.brep' may be used to save shape to file.


Example for DRAWEXE (start from directory ani3D/bin):

   pload                     // this loads modules
   mu4                       // opens view windows
   source ../data/test.tcl   // this generates simple model r
   save r tmp.brep           // save this model to file tmp.brep
   exit                      // exit from DRAWEXE

.brep files could be used with CadToTet_aft.exe tutorial:

./CadToTet_aft.exe tmp.brep
