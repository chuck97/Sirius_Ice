Project name:   GENERATOR OF FEM SYSTEMS ON UNSTRUCTURED TETRAHEDRAL MESHES.

Package name:  Ani3D-FEM.

Documentation: doc/user_guide.pdf

1. What is Ani3D-FEM ?
  The Fortran package Ani3D-FEM generates finite element matrices on
unstructured tetrahedral meshes. The package allows to build elemental
matrices for variety of finite elements and bilinear forms. It allows
to modify these matrices, assemble them, and impose boundary conditions.

This directory presents three examples of using the libraty lib3Dfem.a.
The first example (mainTetrahedron.f) shows how to build elemental matrices.
The second example (mainTemplate.f) shows how to assemble a matrix for 
the Stokes problems. The third example (mainBC.f) shows how to apply various 
boundary conditions. 

The program mainSimple.f shows the old way to assemble matrices. It will
be removed in the next version.
