Project name:   L2 FINITE ELEMENT PROJECTION.

Package name:  Ani3D-PRJ.

Documentation: doc/user_guide.pdf

1. What is Ani3D-PRJ ?
  The Fortran package Ani3D-PRJ project a finite element solution from
one unstructured tetrahedral mesh to another. The solution may belong
to different finite element spaces on different meshes. The meshes should
occupy the same region. Otherwise, the package behavior is unclear.

This directory presents one example of using the libraty lib3Dprj.a 
A given P1 finite solution on one mesh is projected on a P2 finite element
solution on the other mesh.
