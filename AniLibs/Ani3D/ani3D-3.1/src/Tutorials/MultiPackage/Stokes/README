*** Objectives ***

This program generates a finite element system for the Stokes problem

 -div grad u  + grad p = 0   in Omega
       div u           = 0   in Omega

                     u = u_0 on dOmega_1
                     u = 0   on dOmega_2
             du/dn - p = 0   on dOmega_3

where Omega is a backstep domain,
dOmega_1 is the side at x=0, dOmega_3 is the side at x=1,
and dOmega_2 is the rest of the boundary. The non-homogeneous
boundary condition is

   u_0 = { 64*(y-0.5)*(1-y)*z*(1-z), 0, 0 }.

We use the P2 finite elements for the velocity u and P1
finite elements for the pressure p, which are known to
be the stable pair. The discretization method results in
a symmetric indefinite matrix.

Step 1: we generate a quasi-uniform mesh using library libmba3D.a
Step 2: we generate an algebraic system and matrices for preconditioner
        using library libfem3D.a
Step 3: we solve the finite element system using library libILU.a




*** Requirements ***
  lib/libmba3D-2.1.a  or  higher
  lib/libfem3D-2.1.a  or  higher
  lib/libilu-2.1.a    or  higher
  lib/libview3D-2.1.a or higher



*** Quick start ***
ls ../../../lib/    (if the required libraries are missing, build them)
make exe
make run gmv
make clean

If these libraries are missing, please, build them using command
'make lib' in directories src/aniMBA,  src/aniFEM, 
src/aniVIEW and src/aniILU. 



*** Contents ***
   main.f      - Main program with calls routines from the libraries

   forlibfem.f - The user-prepared file for the library libfem3D (matrix 
                 and right-hand side generators). It provides routines
                 for computing the matrix and the right-hand side.

   forlibilu.f - The user-prepared file for the library libilu (iterative
                 solver with ILU preconditioners). It provides evaluation of the block
                 diagonal preconditioner for the saddle point matrix.
