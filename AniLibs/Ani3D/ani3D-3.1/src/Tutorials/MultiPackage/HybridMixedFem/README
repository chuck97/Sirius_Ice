*** Objectives ***

The program demonstrates adaptive solution for the following bvp:
 
    -div u = 0         in  Omega    (mass conservation eqn)
         u = D grad p  in  Omega    (constitutive equation)
         p = 0         on  dOmega_1
         p = 2         on  dOmega_2
 
where Omega is the unit cube (dOmega_1) with a cubic hole 
(dOmega_2) in the center. The full anisotropic diffusion 
tensor D is defined by three rotations of a diagonal 
anisotropic tensor.

We use the mixed-hybrid finite element method with the lowest 
order Raviart-Thomas elements. The method results in a 
problem with a symmetric positive definite stiffness matrix 
for the Lagrange multipliers.

   forlibfem.f - The user-prepared file for the library libfem3D (matrix
                 and right-hand side generators). It provides routines
                 for computing the diffusion tensor, boundary conditions
                 and the right-hand side.
