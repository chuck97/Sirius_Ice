*** Objectives ***
The package demonstrates the iterative adaptive solution of
the boundary value problem:

  div M grad u + (M+L) grad div u = 0 in Omega
                                u = u_0 on Gamma1
                                u = u_0 on Gamma2

where Omega is the union of two parallepipeds rotated about z-axis,
M and L are Lame coefficients, and pull boxes away form each other.

   u_0 = (0, 0, z).
 
The mesh is adapted according to the Hessian of z-component of the
displacement vector. GMV file contains the mesh and z-component of the
displacement vector.


*** Requirements ***
The package requires the following libraries
  lib/libmba3D-2.0.a  or  higher
  lib/libfem3D-2.0.a  or  higher
  lib/liblmr3D-2.0.a  or  higher
  lib/libilu-2.0.a    or  higher
  lib/libview3D-2.0.a or  higher


*** Quick start ***
ls ../../../lib/    (if the required libraries are missing, build them)
make exe
make run gmv 
make clean


If these libraries are missing, please, build them using command
'make lib' in directories src/aniMBA, src/aniFEM, src/aniLMR, src/aniVIEW and 
src/aniILU.


*** Contents ***
   main.f      - Main program with calls routines from the libraries


   forlibfem.f - The user-prepared file for the library libfem3D.
                 It provides routines for calculating the diffusion 
                 tensor, boundary conditions and right-hand side.
