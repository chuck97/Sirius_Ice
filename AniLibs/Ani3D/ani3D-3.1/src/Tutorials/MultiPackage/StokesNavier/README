*** Objectives ***

The program generates and solves a nonlinear finite element system for the
Navier-Stokes problem (backward step):

 -div grad u  + (u.grad) u + grad p = 0   in Omega
       div u                        = 0   in Omega

                                  u = u_0 on dOmega_1
                                  u = 0   on dOmega_2
                          du/dn - p = 0   on dOmega_3

where Omega is a backward step domain,
dOmega_1 is the side at x=0, dOmega_3 is the side at x=1,
and dOmega_2 is the rest of the boundary. The non-homogeneous
boundary condition is

   u_0 = { 64*(y-0.5)*(1-y)*z*(1-z), 0, 0 }.

We use the P2 finite elements for the velocity u and P1
finite elements for the pressure p, which are known to
be stable. The discretization method results in a system of
nonlinear algebraic equations with the saddle point structure.

   main.f      - Main program with calls routines from the libraries

   forlibfem.f - The user-prepared file for the library libfem3D (matrix
                 and right-hand side generators). It provides routines
                 for computing the Stokes matrix, the nonlinear function
                 of Navier-Stokes residual  and the right-hand side.

   forlibinb.f - The user-prepared file for the library libinb (nonlinear
                 solver based on Inexact Newton Backtracking). It provides
                 routines for nonlinear function evaluation and the
                 evaluation of preconditioner for the jacobian.

Step 1: we generate a quasi-uniform mesh using library libmba3D.a
Step 2: we generate the algebraic Stokes system using library libfem3D.a
Step 3: we initialize the preconditioner by factorizing the Stokes matrix with library libLU.a
Step 4: we solve the nonlinear Navier-Stokes system using
        the Inexact Newton-Krylov Backtracking with library libINB.a
