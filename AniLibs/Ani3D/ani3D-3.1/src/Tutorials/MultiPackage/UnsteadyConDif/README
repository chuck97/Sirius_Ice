*** Objectives ***
The package demonstrates the finite element (P_1 SUPG stabilized) solution 
of the unsteady boundary value problem:

  du/dt - div (D grad u) + v * grad u = 0  in  Omega
                                    u = g  on  dOmega
  where Omega = [0;1]x[0;1]x[0;1]

The diffusion coefficient D is the diagonal tensor given by
     D = diag{0.0001,0.0001,0.0001}

The components of the convection vector are
     v = (1, 0, 0)^T

   forlibfem.f - The user-prepared file for the library libfem3D (matrix 
                 and right-hand side generators). It provides routines
                 for computing the diffusion tensor, boundary conditions 
                 and the right-hand side.
