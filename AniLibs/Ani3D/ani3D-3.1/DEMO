#(2) define system variable CASROOT pointing to the OpenCascade location 
#    Example: export CASROOT=/opt/OpenCASCADE
#    If CASROOT is not defined, the interface with OpenCascade will not
#    be installed. For details refer to src/aniAFT/README

#    You may need to install the following packages libXext-devel, 
#    mesa-libGL-devel, mesa-libGLU-devel
