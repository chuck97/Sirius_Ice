The first problem is to construct **triangulations of the square and the sphere** for further computations.

Before building all code in directories make sure that you have build INMOST library (using intel compilers) and Ani2D/Ani3D libraries (using default gcc, g++ and gfortran compilers). 

The best output is generating files:

/MESHES/square8km.pmf 

/MESHES/square4km.pmf 

/MESHES/square2km.pmf 

/MESHES/square1km.pmf 

/MESHES/sphere200km.pmf 

/MESHES/sphere100km.pmf 

/MESHES/sphere50km.pmf 

/MESHES/square8km.vtk 

/MESHES/square4km.vtk 

/MESHES/square2km.vtk 

/MESHES/square1km.vtk 

/MESHES/sphere200km.vtk 

/MESHES/sphere100km.vtk 

/MESHES/sphere50km.vtk
